# Tennis System Analysis

A computer vision-based system for analyzing tennis matches, tracking players, ball trajectories, and court elements in real-time video footage. Built using YOLO for object detection, PyTorch for model implementation, and OpenCV for video processing, this project provides shot statistics and visualizations like a mini court display.

## Features
- **Player and Ball Tracking**: Detects and tracks tennis players and the ball using YOLO object detection.
- **Court Analysis**: Identifies court boundaries and key elements for spatial context.
- **Shot Statistics**: Calculates metrics such as shot count and ball speed.
- **Visualization**: Displays real-time tracking and a mini court overlay for intuitive analysis.
